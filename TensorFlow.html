            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <br>
            <p id="text-2" class="TEXTCOLOUR">
                TensorFlow is a powerful open-source framework for building machine learning models. Developed by Google, 
                <br>TensorFlow allows developers to design,train, and deploy machine learning and deep learning models for various applications,<br>
                from image recognition to natural language processing.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Features</h2>
            <p id="text-2" class="TEXTCOLOUR">
                Scalability: TensorFlow supports both small-scale models and large-scale production environments.<br>
                Deep Learning Support: It provides robust support for deep learning techniques like neural networks.<br>
                Cross-Platform: Works on various platforms, including mobile, desktop, and cloud.<br>
                Visualization Tools: TensorFlow offers tools like TensorBoard to visualize the performance of models.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">How It Works</h2>
            <p id="text-2" class="TEXTCOLOUR">
                TensorFlow provides a comprehensive ecosystem that allows you to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.<br> 
                It uses a computational graph where nodes represent mathematical operations, and edges represent the data flowing between them.<br>
                <br>
                Graphs describe all the operations that take place during the training. Each operation is called an op node and is connected to the other.<br>
                The graph shows the op nodes and the connections between the nodes, but it does not display values.
